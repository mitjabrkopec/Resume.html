        I am an enthusiastic individual with several years of experience in
        electrical engineering and robotics, full of energy and motivation. I value
        myself the most for my teamwork skills, leadership of smaller projects, 
        knowledge of various programming languages (C++, C, LabVIEW, HTML), 
        and the ability to design and execute various electrical engineering 
        projects. I have acquired these skills through various jobs (both as 
        a student and in regular employment) and working for my own 
        company.

                    As a high school professor, I 
                    have the honor and privilege 
                    of shaping the future of future 
                    electrical engineers. I teach them 
                    not only theory but also practical 
                    knowledge that they will need 
                    in their profession. My curriculum 
                    is rich and diverse, covering 
                    subjects such as electrical circuit 
                    design, programming using the 
                    Arduino environment, basics 
                    of electrical engineering, and 
                    programming. All of this requires 
                    constant learning and education, 
                    which is why I have pursued 
                    various certifications myself. I am 
                    especially proud of the education 
                    programs I have organized 
                    for foreigners, as they have 
                    allowed me to spread knowledge 
                    and experiences about electrical 
                    engineering even further.

                <li>
                    As two former students of 
                    electrical engineering at the 
                    Faculty of Electrical Engineering 
                    at the University of Ljubljana, 
                    we created a project called 
                    "Electronics with Robotics". Our 
                    goal was to show children 
                    that electrical engineering is not 
                    only complex but also fun and 
                    interesting.
                    Recently, we have been seeking 
                    to expand our project to a 
                    wider audience, especially among 
                    primary schools. We aim to 
                    introduce children to electrical 
                    engineering through interactive 
                    instructions and video content, so 
                    that they can learn how useful and 
                    relevant electrical engineering is in 
                    today's world.
